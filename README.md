# RoomReady

Housekeeping for a 60-room hotel: from the guest's checkout to a room that is ready for the next one.

## Run it in a container

You need Docker and nothing else: the image builds the app itself. From this folder:

    docker build -t roomready .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 roomready

Open http://localhost:8080/ for the board - or http://<the back-office PC's IP>:8080/ from the front-desk screen.
`http://localhost:8080/actuator/health` answers `{"status":"UP"}` while the app is up and can reach its database.
